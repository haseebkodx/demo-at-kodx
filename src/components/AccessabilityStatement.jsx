        To utilize the Mentor-Protégé Program Portal, you will be required to
        provide your name, work phone number, work email address, and position
        title. As a mentor or protégé, this information is used to link you to
        your company. For federal employees or federal contractors, this
        information is used to link you to your agency. The information you
        provide will be shared with federal agencies participating in the
        Mentor-Protégé Program Agreements, and between mentors and protégés with
        applications or approved agreements. This information will not be used
        outside the Mentor Protégé Program and will not be used for marketing
        purposes. While you must provide the above-mentioned information, we
        recommend that you not include other personal information, including
        home phone numbers and personal email addresses.
